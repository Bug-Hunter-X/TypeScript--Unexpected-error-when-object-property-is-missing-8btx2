This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in TypeScript that arises from optional properties in object types. The `printCoord` function expects an object with `x` and `y` properties. However, if a call to this function provides an object missing either property, TypeScript's type checking will not catch this issue during compilation, leading to a runtime error.  The solution provided demonstrates how to improve the type safety of the function by using optional properties and adding runtime checks.
